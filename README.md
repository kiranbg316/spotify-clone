Spotify Clone 🎵
A basic Spotify clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project allows users to play songs directly on the webpage, making it a fun and interactive way to explore web development.

🚀 Features

📄 Simple and clean user interface.
💻 Fully responsive design for desktop and mobile.

🛠️ Technologies Used

🎯 Motivation
This is my first project, created to learn and practice front-end web development. The goal was to replicate basic functionality of a music player while improving my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🛠️ Future Enhancements
Add a playlist feature.
Include a search bar for songs.
Enhance the UI with animations and transitions.
